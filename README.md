# vm-docker
A Star Trek themed program used in CCDC practice for powering on and off vCenter VMs

## Description
Every year in CCDC, teams are given some sort of custom app that throws a wrench in their plans. In this particular practice, the blue team was not given permission to directly power on and off certain virtual machines on their network. These VMs, all named after ships from Star Trek, had to be "docked" or "undocked" using this program. If red team had access on a machine with vm-docker for too long, they would power off one of the scored VMs.
